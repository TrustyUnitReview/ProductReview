## About The Project

This project is a website created for the purpose of demonstrating and applying all the engineering and programming knowledge that we have acquired throughout our program. This project has been created in accordance to the specifications below:

> Users review Products. These products could be identified by a link to the web site where they are listed. A review consists of a star-rating and some text. Users can also "follow" other users whose reviews they find valuable. A user can then list products for a given category by average rating, or the average rating of only the users they follow. A user can also list the users whose ratings are the most "similar" to their own using the Jaccard distance (google it!). Product reviews can also be ranked according to the similarity score of the people who reviewed them. Users can also list the most followed users. The degree of separation (i.e., distance in the graph) according to the "follow" link can also be displayed next to each reviewer (the assumption is that the "closer" a user is to you, the more trustworthy he/she should be to you)."


## Build With
There are no external libraries required to run the project. 

## Installation
The project can be installed and run by following the steps below:

1. Go to the GitHub website and grabbing the repository found here:
> <https://github.com/TrustyUnitReview/ProductReview> 

Or by entering this command into your terminal:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TrustyUnitReview/ProductReview
```

2. After cloning the repository you can run the project using the main method in the ProductReviewsApplication class
